"""Platform-agnostic guard predicates, shared by the Claude and Cursor adapters.

This file is the single home for every hard block in this repo. It is COPIED, verbatim and
drift-linted, into each plugin's hooks/ dir by bin/cursor-build -- it is never imported
across directories. A marketplace `directory` install resolves ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}
wherever it lands the plugin, so the repo root is not a reliable ancestor; a sys.path hop
would be a bet on the install layout. A copy has no runtime dependency on layout at all.

The load-bearing change from the four guards this replaces: `deny()` no longer exists.
It used to be called from inside every predicate, which welded the Claude wire format and
sys.exit into the policy logic -- so no predicate could be reused across platforms or
tested at all. Predicates now RETURN a Deny; adapters decide what a Deny means on the wire.
That is what makes hooks/test_guard_core.py possible, and these regexes had no tests.

Guard sets are per channel and composed, not inherited. laravel-workspace must NOT
get laravel-core's bare-runner block -- there are no composer scripts above the packages, so
the block would have nothing to redirect to. Composition is what lets git_tag_release exist
once while that divergence stays deliberate.
